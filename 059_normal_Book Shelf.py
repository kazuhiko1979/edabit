"""
Create a Book class that has two attributes:

.title
.author
and two methods:

A method named .get_title() that returns: "Title: " + the instance title.
A method named .get_author() that returns: "Author: " + the instance author.
and instantiate this class by creating 3 new books:

Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen (PP)
Hamlet - William Shakespeare (H)
War and Peace - Leo Tolstoy (WP)
Name the new instances should be PP, H, and WP, respectively.

For instance, if I instantiated the following book using this Book class:

Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling (HP)
I would get the following attributes and methods:

Examples
HP.title ➞ "Harry Potter"
HP.author ➞ "J.K. Rowling"
HP.get_title() ➞ "Title: Harry Potter"
HP.get_author() ➞ "Author: J.K. Rowling"
"""
class Book:

    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author

    def get_title(self):
        return "Title: " + self.title

    def get_author(self):
        return "Author: " + self.author

PP = Book("Pride and Prejudice", "Jane Austen")
H = Book("Hamlet", "William Shakespeare")
WP = Book("War and Peace", "Leo Tolstoy")

print(PP.title)
print(PP.author)
print(PP.get_title())
print(PP.get_author())
