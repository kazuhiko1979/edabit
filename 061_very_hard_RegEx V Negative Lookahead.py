"""
RegEx V: Negative Lookahead
Write a regular expression that will match the states that voted no to President Trump's impeachment. You must use RegEx negative lookahead. You are not allowed to use positive lookaheads.

Example
txt = "Texas = no, California = yes, Florida = yes, Michigan = no"
pattern = "yourregularexpressionhere"

re.findall(pattern, txt) âžž ["Texas", "Michigan"]
Notes
You don't need to write a function, just the pattern.
Do not remove import re from the code.
This is fake data and used only for educational purposes.
