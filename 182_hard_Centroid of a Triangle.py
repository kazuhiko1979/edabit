Centroid of a Triangle
If you have a triangular shape cut from a piece of cardboard, the centroid of the triangle would be the spot where it balances on the point of a pencil. The location of the centroid is easy to calculate if you know the x, y coordinates of the vertices:

The x coordinate of the centroid is at (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3
The y coordinate of the centroid is at (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3
x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 are the coordinates of the three vertices.

Create a function that calculates the position of the centroid given the coordinates of the vertices. Round the answers to two decimal places. If the three points given do not form a triangle, return False.

Examples
centroid(0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3) ➞ (2.0, 1.0)

centroid(2, 2, 8, -2, 0, -3) ➞ (3.33, -1.0)

centroid(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3) ➞ False
Notes
The arguments are given in the order shown above: x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3.
If the three points do not form a triangle, they must lie in a straight line.
