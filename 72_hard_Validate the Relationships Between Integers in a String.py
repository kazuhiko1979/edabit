Validate the Relationships Between Integers in a String
You will be given a string consisting of a list of integers and their relationships to their neighboring integers. For instance:

"-15<-10<=0=0<5"
Test to see that all the relationships between the integers in the string are true. If they are, return True. If they are not, return False.

Examples
validate_relationships("5>-1<0=0<-5>5=5") ➞ False
# This is False because 0 is not less than -5.

validate_relationships("-15<-10<=0=0<5") ➞ True

validate_relationships("0=807<1000<=1000>9990<-3605<=20") ➞ False
# This is False because 0 is not equal to 807.
Notes
This is a modifcation of Helen Yu's "Correct Signs" challenge.
As the examples above show, there could be negative numbers in the string.
The numbers will only be separated by: =, <, >, >=, <=
Tests will not contain any spaces.
