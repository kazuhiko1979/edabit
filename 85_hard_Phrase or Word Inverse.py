"""
Phrase or Word Inverse
Create a function that inverts words or the phrase depending on the value of parameter type. A "P" means to invert the entire phrase, while a "W" means to invert every word in the phrase. See the following examples for clarity.

Examples
inverter("This is Valhalla", "P") ➞ "Valhalla is this"

inverter("One fine day to start", "W") ➞ "Eno enif yad ot trats"

inverter("Division by powers of two", "P") ➞ "Two of powers by division"
Notes
The first character of the returned string should be in uppercase and the rest are in lowercase.
There will be no empty strings as inputs. Punctuation marks, though quite important for grammatical correctness, are discounted in the input phrases.
