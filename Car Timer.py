"""
A built-in timer inside your car can count the length of your ride in minutes and you have started your ride at 00:00.

Given the number of minutes n at the end of the ride, calculate the current time. Return the sum of digits that the digital timer in the format hh:mm will show at the end of the ride.

Examples
car_timer(240) ➞ 4
# 240 minutes have passed since 00:00, the current time is 04:00
# Digits sum up is 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 4
car_timer(808) ➞ 14
car_timer(14) ➞ 5
