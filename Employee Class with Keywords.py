"""
Create a class Employee that will take a full name as argument, as well as a set of none, one or more keywords. Each instance should have a name and a lastname attributes plus one more attribute for each of the keywords, if any.

Examples
john = Employee("John Doe")
mary = Employee("Mary Major", salary=120000)
richard = Employee("Richard Roe", salary=110000, height=178)
giancarlo = Employee("Giancarlo Rossi", salary=115000, height=182, nationality="Italian")

john.name ➞ "John"
mary.lastname ➞ "Major"
richard.height ➞ 178
giancarlo.nationality ➞ "Italian"
Notes
First and last names will be separated by a whitespace. The test will not include any middle names or initials.
The value of the keywords can be an int, a str or a list.
