"""
Images can be described as 3D lists.

# This image has only one white pixel:

[
  [[255, 255, 255]]
]
# This one is a 2 by 2 black image:

[
  [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
  [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
]
Your task is to create a function that takes a 3D list representation of an image and returns the grayscale version of that.

Examples
grayscale([
  [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 157]],
  [[1, 100, 0], [0, 10, 0]]
]) âžž [
  [[0, 0, 0], [52, 52, 52]],
  [[34, 34, 34], [3, 3, 3]]
]
Notes
A valid RGB value ranges from 0 to 255 (inclusive).
If the given list contains out of bound values, convert them to the nearest valid one.
Grayscaling an image is adjusting to have the same amount of (Red, Green, Blue) from their combined average to produce different shades of gray.
