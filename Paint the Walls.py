Given a predetermined rate from a dictionary, write the function that will return the time it takes for a certain amount of people to paint a certain amount of walls. Return the minutes as an integer. No rounding is necessary.

Example
// It takes 22 minutes for 10 people to paint 10 walls.
// How many minutes does it take 14 people to paint 14 walls?
