"""
Given a sentence, return the number of words which have the same first and last letter.

Examples
count_same_ends("Pop! goes the balloon") ➞ 1

count_same_ends("And the crowd goes wild!") ➞ 0

count_same_ends("No I am not in a gang.") ➞ 1
Notes
Don't count single character words (such as "I" and "A" in example #3).
The function should not be case sensitive, meaning a capital "P" should match with a lowercase one.
Mind the punctuation!
Bonus points indeed for using regex!
